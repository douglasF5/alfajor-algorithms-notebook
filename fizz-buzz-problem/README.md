## Problem description

- Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N.
- For multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number.
- For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.
