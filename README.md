# Alfajor Data Structures and Algorithms scratchpad

This repository contains exercises in which I implement basic (or not so basic) data structures and algorithms. Besides the code itself, some files may contain comments about the implementation and some directories may contain markdown files with notes, resources, and research findings used during the exercise.

Because the main goal here is to explore with different methods and techniques to solve common computational problems, the code can be written in any language I feel like, as long as my practice is kept aligned with my goals.

p.s.: Why is it called Alfajor? ðŸ¤” Because I like the way it sounds. ðŸ˜†
