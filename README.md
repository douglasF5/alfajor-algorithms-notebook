## Algorithms scratchpad

This repository contains a few exercises in which I implement basic (or not so basic) algorithms. Besides the code itself, some files may contain comments about the implementation and some directories may contain markdown files with notes, resources and research findings used during the exercise.

p.s.: Why is it called Alfajor? ðŸ¤” Because I like the way it sounds. ðŸ˜†
