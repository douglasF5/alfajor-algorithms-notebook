## About

- This function uses recursion to generate a sequence of pseudo random numbers with a user defined length
- It does this by leveraging the Math.radom function to generate the individual digits every time the function calls itself
- The outcome can be a number or a string (specially in case you want it to have a prefix such as "#" or "@")
