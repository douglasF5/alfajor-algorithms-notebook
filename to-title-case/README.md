## About

- Create a function that change the first letter of a string to upper case
- It is expected that every time you pass a string, array or object to the function, it returns the same type of data structure with each word inside it starting with a capital letter,
otherwise, it should return a message telling the user that it couldn't interpret the content inside the variable
